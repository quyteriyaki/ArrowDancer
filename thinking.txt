How does the lazy thing work?

A. Scoring
Goal: Lowest moves / combo or highest combo / move

B. Deciding teams
There's several things to consider:
- Dance set
- Team order
- Starting witch

wait that's it?
Team order has 2 combinations
Starting witch has 3 combinations
In total 6 combinations

Total dance has 8 combinations

In total 48 combinations

C. Deciding starting position
- Total moves is based on movement between starting positions (start / end) / cycle
Per combination will already have a starting character
All characters will be aligned to the first formation
This assumes that the 1st move is moving into formation (1. complete formation)

Every character will have at most 4 moves - total 12 moves max possible
Min length of team sequence is the sum of all sequences (S)
Est moves simulated would therefore be S^12

A swap counts as 1

D. Standards
- Cartesian coordinate system
- FGC BP notation
